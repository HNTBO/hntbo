## Overview

A browser extension that enhances bookmark management with powerful search and tagging capabilities. Built for people who bookmark everything and then can never find anything.

## Features

- **Full-text search**: Search bookmark titles, URLs, and descriptions
- **Tag system**: Organize bookmarks with custom tags
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Quick access without leaving your workflow
- **Import/Export**: Backup and sync your bookmarks across browsers

## The Problem

Browser bookmark systems are designed for hierarchical folder organization, but that doesn't match how we actually think about saved links. Tags and search work better.

## Installation

Available for Chrome and Firefox through their respective extension stores.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Shift+B` - Open bookmark search
- `Ctrl+D` - Quick save with tags
- `Esc` - Close popup
