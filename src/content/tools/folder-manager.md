## Overview

A modern tool for managing folders — available as a browser app and a Windows desktop app. Three tools in one:

- **Delete Empty Folders** — Scan and remove empty folder hierarchies
- **Duplicate Structure** — Copy a folder tree without files (great for project templates)
- **Count Files** — See how many files are at root level vs. nested in subfolders

## Web Version

The browser version runs entirely in your browser using the **File System Access API** — no install, no upload, your files never leave your machine.

**Requirements:** Chrome, Edge, Brave, or Opera (Chromium-based browsers). Firefox and Safari don't support the File System Access API — use the desktop version instead.

## Features

- Preview before action — always see what will change
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Detailed logging of all operations
- Desktop version built with Python and CustomTkinter

## Use Cases

- Clean up old project folders cluttered with empty directories
- Set up consistent folder structures for new projects
- Quickly audit folder contents before reorganizing
