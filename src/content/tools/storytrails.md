## The Problem

AI video generation tools are shot-focused, not film-focused. You generate images and clips, but there's no continuity, no narrative structure, no production pipeline. Creative decisions get lost across browser tabs, chat windows, and downloads folders.

## The Solution

Storytrails sits between "I have an idea" and "I have footage to edit." It's not another generation tool—it's a system that captures your creative process.

**Core concept: Trails**

A Trail captures your creative journey for each shot—every prompt iteration, generation, edit, and decision. Unlike arbitrary version folders (v01, v02...), trails are meaningful work blocks with full context.

## Features

- **Visual storyboard** — Organize shots on a familiar grid
- **Trail tracking** — Every iteration saved with context
- **Character/location library** — Maintain consistency across shots
- **Export to edit** — File-based output for your NLE

## Status

- **v1** — Used in production on a music video project
- **v2** — Currently in development

First public version available for download soon.
