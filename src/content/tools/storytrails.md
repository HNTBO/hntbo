## Overview

A web-based storyboarding application designed for video creators. Combines traditional storyboard workflows with AI assistance for shot descriptions and visual planning.

## Features

- **Visual timeline**: Drag-and-drop shot arrangement
- **AI shot descriptions**: Generate detailed shot descriptions from brief notes
- **Export options**: PDF storyboards, shot lists, and script formats
- **Collaboration**: Share boards with team members

## Workflow Integration

Storytrails fits into the pre-production phase of video projects. Start with rough ideas, refine them with AI assistance, then export production-ready documents.

## Why AI Assistance?

Writing detailed shot descriptions is time-consuming but essential for communication with crew and clients. AI helps expand brief notes into professional descriptions while you focus on the creative vision.

## Status

Currently in development. Check the GitHub repository for updates and early access.
