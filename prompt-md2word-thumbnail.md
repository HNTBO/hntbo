# Banana Pro Prompt — Markdown to Word Converter Thumbnail

## Prompt

A clean, modern tool card thumbnail at 16:10 aspect ratio. Soft light blue-grey gradient background with a subtle frosted feel and faint geometric texture at low opacity.

Center-left: two frosted glass (glassmorphism) panels stacked vertically, slightly overlapping. The top panel contains a cartoon-style Markdown document icon — a white page with a dark outline, showing a "#" heading symbol, a few horizontal lines of text, and a bold "**" marker, representing Markdown syntax. The bottom panel contains a cartoon-style Word document icon — a blue-tinted page with the "W" logo and neatly formatted paragraph lines, representing a .docx file.

Between the two panels, a stylized curved arrow flows from the Markdown icon down to the Word icon, suggesting conversion/transformation. The arrow has a warm orange gradient matching the title color.

Right side: large bold 3D-style text reading "MARKDOWN TO WORD" in two lines, with a warm orange-to-red gradient fill and a subtle embossed/extruded effect. Soft warm glow behind the text. Below the title, a smaller subtitle in a frosted glass pill reads "Browser Converter".

The overall feel is clean, modern, slightly playful — like a polished app store card. No dark colors, no photographic elements, illustrated graphic style only.
